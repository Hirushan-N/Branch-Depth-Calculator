# Branch Depth Calculator

This code calculates the depth of a hierarchical structure using a recursive algorithm.

The `Branch` class represents a branch of the hierarchical structure, and has a `CalculateDepth()` method that recursively calculates the depth of the branch.

In the `Program.cs` file, a hierarchical structure is created by instantiating `Branch` objects and adding them to each other's `branches` list. The depth of the structure is then calculated using the `CalculateDepth()` method of the root `Branch` object.

To run the code, simply compile and execute the `Program.cs` file. The output will display the depth of the hierarchical structure.
